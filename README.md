## 🌍 Introduction

**Azora OS** is a revolutionary ecosystem that combines **education**, **development tools**, and **economic opportunity** into one seamless platform. Built on the principles of **Ubuntu** ("I am because we are") and powered by **Constitutional AI**, Azora provides the infrastructure for a new digital economy where technology serves humanity.

Unlike traditional platforms, Azora is governed by a [Constitution](CONSTITUTION.md) that ensures truth, transparency, and collective prosperity. It is an antifragile system designed to empower learners, builders, and creators through:

*   **Constitutional AI**: AI agents (Elara, Kofi, Zuri) that operate under strict ethical guardrails.
*   **Ubuntu Economics**: A tokenomic model where individual success multiplies collective wealth.
*   **Sankofa Engine**: A powerful core that integrates historical wisdom with future technology.

## 🏗️ Monorepo Structure

Azora OS is a high-performance monorepo managed with **Turborepo** and **npm workspaces**.

## 🛡️ BuildSpaces Production Readiness Snapshot

### Architectural overview
- **Framework**: Next.js 16 with React 19
- **Editor**: Monaco + Yjs for multiplayer collaboration
- **Execution**: WebContainer-backed terminals
- **Data**: Prisma ORM with Postgres adapters
- **Collaboration**: CRDT sync, AI routing, and Kubernetes-ready manifests

### Current state
- Overall BuildSpaces readiness: **85% complete**
- **10 functional rooms** live in the current stack
- Kubernetes manifests exist for core services and ingress

### Production gaps to close
- Missing **Dockerfile** to produce deployable images
- **Jest** configuration absent; `npm test` fails
- No **health checks** for liveness/readiness
- No **rate limiting** middleware in front of APIs
- Absent **security headers** in Next.js/edge handlers

### Mock data violations to remove
- Command Desk
- Knowledge Ocean
- Design Studio
- AI Studio
- Maker Lab

### Quick start and deployment prerequisites
- Node.js 20+, npm 10+
- Docker for local orchestration and K8s parity
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill provider keys
- Run `npm ci` then `npm run dev` for local development
- For production: add Dockerfile, health endpoints, rate limiting, and security headers before deploying manifests

## 📜 Constitutional AI & Ethics

Azora OS is unique because it is governed by code-enforced laws.

*   **[CONSTITUTION.md](CONSTITUTION.md)**: The supreme law of the platform. All code and AI decisions must align with these principles.
*   **[AI_DEV_LAWS.md](AI_DEV_LAWS.md)**: The "Twin Pact" governing AI assistants. It mandates **Truth over Comfort**, **Resilience**, and the **No Mock Protocol**.

> *"Truth is the only currency that matters."*
