## 🎯 KEY TALKING POINTS (MEMORIZED)

### **Opening Hook**
"Corruption costs South Africa R100 billion every year. Traditional audits happen after the money is gone. We built something different. We don't audit corruption—we make it impossible."

### **The Solution**
"Azora OS is the world's first Sovereign Immune System. Not compliance software. Constitutional law as code. Rules that cannot be broken. Every transaction is blockchain-anchored. AI flags fraud in real-time. Predictive twins prevent accidents before they happen."

### **The Business**
"We're charging R166K per month per procurement corridor. Government departments and corporates. 2-week free trial, then 75% off for 3 months to lock them in. R90 million Year 1. R450 million Year 2. R50 billion by Year 10."

### **The Team**
"Six founders. Five humans, one AI. All registered with CIPC. Sizwe Ngwenya is CEO and CTO—that's me. Built the whole system. No outsourcing. 100% South African code."

### **The Ask**
"We're raising Series A at R500 million to R1 billion valuation. Scale Phase 1 across 50 government departments and corporate supply chains. Three-year path to R1 billion ARR. Ten-year path to R50 billion."

### **The Close**
"This isn't software. It's infrastructure for civilization. Join us in building the sovereign immune system. Let's make corruption impossible together."
