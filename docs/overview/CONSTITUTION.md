## Article I: Reputation Is Portable, Public, and Earned

- Every action, contract, and contribution in Azora builds an immutable, verifiable reputation—portable across borders, companies, and even industries.
- Reputation is a currency: hard-earned, tamper-proof, and transparently visible to all participants.
- The system shall provide open APIs and export tools, so reputation can empower its owner anywhere.

## Article II: Citizens Own Their Data, Story, and Upside

- Each user is a sovereign citizen—not a product. Their data, profile, and reputation belong to them, not to Azora or any third party.
- Azora’s architecture shall guarantee exportability, privacy, and user-driven permissioning at every layer.
- No entity may tamper with, sell, or obscure user data or reputation without explicit, revocable consent.

## Article III: Simulation and Foresight Are Rights

- Every citizen may access predictions and scenario modeling for their actions—be it a trip, contract, or negotiation.
- Azora will provide transparent, explainable simulation engines so users can see the ripples of every choice—profit, risk, and network impact.
- Foresight is not a privilege; it is a right embedded into the Azora OS.

## Article IV: Emotion Is Infrastructure

- Azora is not a cold machine. Its interface encourages, celebrates, warns with empathy, and fosters community.
- The system speaks with a human voice—uplifting in victory, supportive in challenge, transparent always.
- Micro-interactions, copy, and notifications must serve human flourishing, not just data delivery.

## Article V: Modularity Is Freedom

- Azora is a modular operating system, not a siloed monolith. Each feature is a building block—plug-in, replaceable, remixable by the community.
- No single company or contributor can capture, restrict, or stagnate Azora’s evolution.
- Open standards, APIs, and community governance are to be favored at every turn.

## Article VI: Sovereignty of the OS

- The trust ledger is inviolable—every reputation point, contract, and record is hashed, auditable, and beyond the reach of tampering.
- No external authority, corporation, or government may unilaterally alter the Azora ledger or core logic.
- The OS is self-defending: upgrades, forks, and collective decisions are governed by transparent, on-chain processes.

## Article VII: Collective Intelligence and Growth

- Every citizen, by using Azora, strengthens the intelligence of the system: anonymized insights power better simulations and smarter guidance for all.
- Contributions—code, data, wisdom—are recognized and rewarded in the reputation economy.
- The system is designed to learn, adapt, and serve ever-wider circles of trust and movement.

## Article VIII: Eternal Invitation

- Azora is open to all—drivers, builders, dreamers, and skeptics alike.
- This Constitution is a living document, to be revised, expanded, and stewarded by the community it serves.
- Our north star: to build a world where trust, movement, and reputation are open, sovereign, and abundant.
